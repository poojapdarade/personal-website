        CSS : Cascading style sheets. </p>
    <br>There are 3 different places you can write CSS:
    <ol>
        <li>Internal</li>
        <li>External</li>
        <li>Inline</li>
    </ol>
    <p>syntax for css:</p>
    selector {
    property= property_value
    }
    <p>3 types of selectors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Element - Least specific </li>
        <li>Class - More specific</li>
        <li>ID - More specific than Class but not recommended</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>!important : Overrides every other rule but it is not recommended to use for beginners </li>
    </ul>

            What is selectors?
            In CSS, selectors are patterns that target HTML elements for styling. They can select elements by type,
            class, ID, attributes, or their relationship with other elements. Selectors help apply styles selectively to
            specific parts of a web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Colors:

            In CSS, colors define how elements look. You can use names (like red), hexadecimal (#ff0000), RGB (rgb(255,
            0, 0)), or HSL (hsl(0, 100%, 50%)). Colors can also have transparency with RGBA or HSLA values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unit & Sizes:
            In CSS, units and sizes define measurements for properties like length and width. Common units include
            pixels (`px`), percentage (`%`), em (based on font size), rem (based on root font size), and viewport units
            (`vw` and `vh`). Absolute units like centimeters, millimeters, inches, points, and picas are also used for
            specific scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            Box Model:
            The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that defines the layout of elements on a web page. It consists of
            four main components:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Content:
                - The actual content or text of the element.</li>
            <li>Padding:
                - The space between the content and the element's border.</li>

            <li>Border:
                - A border surrounding the padding.</li>
            <li>Margin:
                - The space between the border and the neighboring elements.</li>
        </ol>
        Understanding and manipulating these components allows for precise control over the spacing and layout of
        elements on a webpage.

        Typography:
        In CSS, typography refers to styling and formatting text on a webpage, including font properties (family,
        size, color), line height, letter spacing, and text alignment.
