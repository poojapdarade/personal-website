    <p>The commands I have learned so far:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>git add</li>
        <li>git status</li>

        <li>git pull</li>
        <li>git branch</li>
        <li>git checkout</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The commands I am planning to learn in further while I learn about branches:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>git merge</li>
        <li>git remote</li>
        <li>git fetch</li>
        <li>git reset</li>
        <li>git diff</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Detailed description of the commands I know which are listed above:</p>
    <h2>git add</h2>
    <p>
        In Git, the `git add` command is used to stage changes for the next commit. When you make modifications to your
        project, such as adding new files or editing existing ones, these changes are initially untracked by Git. By
        using `git add`, you inform Git that you want to include these changes in the next commit. Staging changes
        allows you to selectively choose which modifications should be part of the next snapshot of your project. This
        separation between working directory changes and the staging area provides flexibility and precision in crafting
        commits, as it enables you to commit specific changes while keeping others uncommitted for further refinement.
        git add <file-name> (to add a specific file)
            git add -A (adds all changed files to staging ready to be committed)
    </p>
    <h2>git status</h2>
    <p>
        The git status command in Git provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of your repository. When
        executed, it displays information about any changes in your working directory compared to the last committed
        version. This includes untracked files, modifications to tracked files, and files that are staged for the next
        commit. git status is a valuable tool for understanding the status of your project, helping you keep track of
        changes, and guiding you on what actions are needed, such as committing changes or adding files to the staging
        area. It provides a snapshot of the repository's status, allowing you to make informed decisions about the next
        steps in your version control workflow.
        For example, if you have added a file to git by using git add ''file_name'' and also do a git commit when you do
        git status it will show a message ''branch is one ahead'' of origin
    </p>
    <h2>git push</h2>
    <p>
        The git push command is used in Git to upload the committed changes from your local repository to a remote
        repository. It enables you to synchronize your work with a shared or central repository, making your changes
        accessible to others collaborating on the project. By specifying the remote repository and branch you want to
        push to, such as git push origin master, you update the corresponding branch on the remote with your local
        commits, ensuring that both repositories are in sync and reflecting the latest state of the project.
    </p>
    <h2>git commit</h2>
    <p>The git pull command in Git is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local working
        branch. When you run git pull, it automatically combines the git fetch command, which retrieves the latest
        changes from the remote repository, with the git merge command, which incorporates those changes into your local
        branch. This ensures that your local copy is updated with the most recent modifications from the remote
        repository, providing a seamless way to keep your local branch in sync with the collaborative development
        happening in the shared repository.
    </p>
    <h2>git clone</h2>
    <p>
        The git clone command in Git is used to create a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. When you run
        git clone, it not only copies the repository but also sets up a connection to the remote, allowing you to fetch
        and pull changes from the original repository. This command is commonly used when starting a new project or when
        you want to contribute to an existing one. The cloned repository contains the entire project history, branches,
        and files, providing you with a complete and independent working copy that you can modify and contribute to
        while maintaining a link to the original repository for updates.
    </p>
    <h2>git log</h2>
    <p>
        It returns the git commit history, each log contains when the change happened, who did it and also the commit
        message.
    </p>
    <h2>git pull</h2>
    <p>
        The git pull command in Git is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local working
        branch. When you run git pull, it automatically combines the git fetch command, which retrieves the latest
        changes from the remote repository, with the git merge command, which incorporates those changes into your local
        branch. This ensures that your local copy is updated with the most recent modifications from the remote
        repository, providing a seamless way to keep your local branch in sync with the collaborative development
        happening in the shared repository.
    </p>
    <h2>git branch</h2>
    <p>
        The git branch command is used to create, list, and delete branches. Branches allow developers to work on their
        code and create commits in isolation
    </p>
    <p>
        To delete a branch we use <code>git branch -D branch_name</code> command.
    </p>
    <h2>git checkout</h2>
    <p>
        The git checkout command is used to navigate between branches. You can use
        <code>git checkout -b branch_name</code> command
        to create and jump to a new branch.
    </p>
    <h2>git merge</h2>
    <p>
        <code>git merge branch_name</code> takes commits from a branch into current branch. 
    </p>
