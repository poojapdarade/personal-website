    <h3>Important things to know to write Javascript</h3>
    <ol class="js-notes">
        <li>First thing we are going to learn is <b>comments in the javascript</b><br><code>//</code> is used for
            in-line comments<br><code>/* */</code> is used for multi-line comment<br>You end every line in Javascript
            with ; semicolon</li>
        <li>Data types<br>undefined: Something which has not been defined yet<br>null: When you set this property to an
            element that results nothing for the output for that element<br>boolean: True or False<br>string : set of
            characters<br>symbol: A symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique<br>number: numbers<br>object:
            An object can store a lot of different key value pairs.<br></li>
        <li>Variables:<br> We often set data into a variable. A variable allows computers to store and manipulate data
            in a
            dynamic fashion. It is basically a label to point to a data. To declare variable<br>There are three ways to
            declare
            <br><code>var muName = "Beau" followed by myName = 8 </code><br><code>let ourName = "Pooja"</code><br><code>const yourName = "John"</code><br>A
            difference between <code>var</code>,<code>const</code> and <code>let</code>. A var is going to be able to
            be
            used throughout your whole program. Let will only be able to use within scope where you declare that and
            const is a variable that can never change. There is difference between declaring the variable and assigning
            the
            variable.<br><code> var a; This how to declare variable.</code><br><code>var b=2; By using = assignment operator we can assign variable to a value.</code><br><code>console.log(a) console.log allows you to see things in the console. </code><br>
        </li>
    </ol>
