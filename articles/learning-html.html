        <ul>
            <li>Website: Frontend-Interface of an user application which is visible to user. Your browser started by
                loading
                the main HTML file, then css and Javascript.
            </li>
            <li>Server: Backend- Holds and manages all the data. Once you've developed your website you need to host it
                on a
                server to make it accessible on the internet.</li>
            <li>Address : Address assigned to website in order to accessible on internet. Website is hosted on IP

        <li>What is HTML?</li>
        <p>HTML is a widely used markup language for developing web pages.It defines the structure of websites and
            formats web pages. Following are some elements of HTML:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DOCTYPE: It is an instruction which indicates the browser that the document type to be served to the
                user is a HTML document. It should be included at very top of your HTML page.</li>
            <li>HTML: Contains all the webpage's code.</li>
            <li>Head: This is the first section of the code that contains all of the information the webpage's
                properties, links and more.It can have pages, title, description, CSS Code and meta tags.</li>

                containers, tables and more.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

            <tr>
                <th>Tags</th>
